# My-LeetCode-problem-Solving
These are some of the leetcode problems I worked on. As a newbie every problem is teaching me something, sometimes about the library, often times the syntax and their meanings. I compiled all these, so I can refer them in future, or if helps, you can check them too. Happy Coding :)



* In Python, if a function is designed to combine two lists and it doesn't return a new list (returns None), it must be modifying one of the inputs directly. Eg. In merge sorted array problem: If it weren't modifying nums1 in-place, the result of the merge would be lost as soon as the function finished.
